# pokemon-project

As of now, this is a program that will generate a PokeMon with random stats (yet accurate to the games) and add it to your party of up to 6.
(Support for generations 1-8)


TO-DO:
  > Add generation 9 data
  > Implementation of functions that edit existing PokeMon (change EVs, IVs, held item, etc.)
  > Organization and implementation of movesets and items
  > Possibly a GUI
